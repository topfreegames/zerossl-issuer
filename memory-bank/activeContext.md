# ZeroSSL Issuer Active Context

## Current Status
The project is in active development with core functionality implemented:
- Basic controller structure
- ZeroSSL API client
- CRD definitions
- RBAC configuration
- Container setup
- Test framework
- DNS solver with Route53 support for CNAME validation

## Recent Changes
1. Initial project setup with Kubebuilder
2. Implementation of ZeroSSL API client
3. Basic controller structure
4. Configuration of deployment resources
5. Setup of test infrastructure
6. DNS solver implementation with Route53 support
7. Enhanced domain matching for certificate requests
8. CNAME-based DNS validation implementation

## Active Decisions

### Implementation Decisions
1. Using Kubebuilder 4.7.0 for project scaffolding
2. Implementing cert-manager external issuer interface
3. Using distroless container for minimal attack surface
4. Implementing secure metrics endpoint
5. Following cert-manager's DNS solver pattern
6. Starting with Route53 as first DNS provider
7. Domain-based solver selection strategy
8. Using CNAME validation method for DNS challenges
9. Using a dedicated Challenge resource to manage DNS validation

### Open Questions
1. Rate limiting strategy for ZeroSSL API
2. Certificate renewal timing optimization
3. Additional DNS provider support
