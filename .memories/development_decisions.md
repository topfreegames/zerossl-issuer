# Development Decisions and Changes

This file tracks important development decisions and significant changes made to the project.

## Initial Setup (Current)

### Project Initialization
- Used kubebuilder to scaffold the project
- Set domain to `zerossl.dev`
- Configured Go modules for dependency management

### API Design Decisions
1. **API Version**: Started with v1alpha1 as this is a new project
2. **Required Fields**:
   - `apiKey`: Required for ZeroSSL API authentication
3. **Optional Fields**:
   - `validityDays`: Set default to 90 days with range 1-365
   - `strictDomains`: Default to true for secure validation

### Implementation Decisions
1. **Client Structure**:
   - Separated core client functionality from certificate operations
   - Implemented robust error handling
   - Added API key validation

2. **Controller Design**:
   - Implemented basic reconciliation loop
   - Added status conditions for better observability
   - Included comprehensive logging

## Future Decisions to Consider

1. **Certificate Management**:
   - How to handle certificate renewal
   - Validation method selection
   - Error recovery strategies

2. **Security**:
   - API key storage method
   - Secret management
   - Access control implementation

3. **Scalability**:
   - Rate limiting implementation
   - Cache strategy
   - Resource management

## Change Log

### v0.1.0 (Initial Setup)
